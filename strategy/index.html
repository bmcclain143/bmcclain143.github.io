	<h1>Business Model and Strategy</h1>
	<p>Shipwaves operates on a pay-as-you-go basis and earns money from an SMB (small and mid-sized business) when it blocks freight to ship goods. Seafood, cement, and machinery represent some of the shippers from diverse verticals with which Shipwaves has already established success.  
Itemized charges are clearly laid out upfront for any value added services so that shippers are not surprised at any point in the process, instilling trust in Shipwaves and repeat use of the platform. 

<p>The company has a strong presence in various ports within India (Ludhiana, Ahmedabad, Pune, Mumbai, Mangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad) and plans to expand globally in the coming years. The Shipwaves current client base has been built purely based on personal contacts and testimonials. Athahar and Shahid are focused on presenting at industry platforms and building contacts through their trade platform as a means for continually growing the client base.
