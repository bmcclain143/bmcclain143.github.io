	<h1>Deal Concerns</h1>
	<p>Shipwaves relies fundamentally upon senior logistics experts to follow and make tactical recommendations regarding each shipment. Without a robust hiring plan  and keeping the current experts in house as the business scales, success of the company could be hindered.  
  <p>India’s general lack of developing infrastructure presents has the potential to present challenges and introduces instability for the company’s continued success.
<p>Competitors at a similar stage as Shipwaves pose a threat based on time to scale. It’s plausible that companies like ODex and Shipping Exchange make strides to surpass Shipwaves if the company does not gain the traction and support needed in order to scale quickly.</a></p>
