	<h1>Competition</h1>
	<p>Shipwaves faces larger, more established Indian headquartered logistic competitors like BlueDart, DTDC, and Aegis Logistics, but the company’s focus on digitization provides an opportunity for rapid scale.
		
  <p>Although not headquartered in India, other larger logistics companies like DHL, Keuhne Nagal and DB Shenkers are recognizing that they’ll need to hone in on how to stay ahead of these emerging logistics-centralized technology startups.
	
  <p>ODex and Shipping exchange could be two of Shipwaves bigger competitors. Shipping Exchange shares a similar business model as Shipwaves and is scaling at a similar pace as Shipwaves. ODex offers digital communication to shippers.</a><p>
