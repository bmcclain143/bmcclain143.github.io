	<h1>Glimmer of Greatness and Recommendation</h1>
	<p>At the height of its potential, Shipwaves monopolizes the $200 billion Indian ocean freight industry with a platform that accelerates leads for freight forwarders over time. A consolidated platform that intertwines all freight forwarders, shipping lines, and SMBs creates an established community that is harmonious where all parties are profitable and are moving business quickly and more efficiently.  In an ideal state, the company continues to establish various ports within the country and tackles global expansion, instituting seamless and reliable trade by leveraging the power of technology - a feat that has yet to be accomplished in a consistent manner. 
  
  <p>Finally, I do believe that Dynamo should invest in Shipwaves based on the following points:
      <p>Although an in-person meeting would be preferred in order to solidify this, the persistence, passion, and commitment demonstrated by the founding team as noted in previous interviews as well as their foundational client base is impressive. 
  <p>The market and its current and continued growth is undeniable, and with the appropriate investment and mentorship - the companyâ€™s solution could take the ocean freight industry in India (and eventually globally) to the next level.
  <p>Intertwining a straightforward user interface with associated logistics experts should address the problem of stifling business growth by improving transparency and efficiency of the ocean freight industry, reducing costs and frustrations.
  <p>Shipwaves has the potential to create a network of shippers that scales beyond what has previously existed within the industry, introucing consolidation and creating endless opportunity for both growth as well as profits.
  
  <p>My recommendation for investment is: $250,000.</a></p>
